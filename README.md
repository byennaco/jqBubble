jqBubble
========

A JQuery widget for showing context-sensitive information for any form element in a popup bubble (aka tooltip).

Bubbles can be attached to any element and are automatically positioned to account for target element position on the page and page scroll such that they will always be visible on the page.  Bubbles will be positioned above/right, above left, bottom/left, or bottom right of the target using callout arrows to point to the target.  Each bubble contains a title and content, where content can be any HTML markup.  Hover over an element and the bubble appears immediately or after a configureable delay.  Move off the target or bubble and the bubble disappears immediately or after a configureable delay.

Bubble markup containing title and content can be sent with the page or created automatically in the browser.
